            <p>
                My educational journey began at Yatagala National School, a well-regarded institution where I laid the foundation of my academic career. Here, I completed my primary education, culminating in the successful attainment of my Ordinary Level (O/L) qualifications.

            <p>
                Following my time at Yatagala National School, I pursued higher education at Karandeniya Central College. This phase of my education was marked by a deepened focus on my academic and extracurricular pursuits. At Karandeniya Central College, I engaged in a rigorous curriculum that prepared me for my Advanced Level (A/L) examinations in the Bio System Technology section. I successfully passed the A/L exam, which was a testament to my hard work and dedication.

            <p>
                Currently, I am advancing my studies in the field of software engineering at the Institute of Software Engineering (IJSE). My choice to specialize in software engineering stems from a profound interest in technology and a desire to contribute to the ever-evolving digital landscape. At IJSE, I am immersed in an intensive program designed to equip me with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.
                My academic experiences have been complemented by various projects and hands-on experiences, allowing me to apply what I have learned in real-world scenarios.
